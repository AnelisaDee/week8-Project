# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A Jupyter Notebook project that analyzes and visualizes global COVID-19 data, including cases, deaths, and vaccinations across countries and over time. The project uses real-world data from Our World in Data and applies data science techniques to draw insights and trends from the pandemic.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze time trends: total cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare COVID-19 metrics across selected countries
- Visualize trends using clear and informative plots
- Communicate findings through a well-documented notebook

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Python**
- **pandas** – for data loading and manipulation
- **matplotlib** – for visualizations
- **seaborn** – for enhanced plotting
- **plotly** *(optional)* – for interactive or choropleth maps

📊 Data Source
Our World in Data – COVID-19 Dataset

📈 Key Insights
The USA had the highest total number of cases and deaths, but also one of the most aggressive vaccination rollouts.

India experienced a sharp surge in cases during the second wave in mid-2021.

Kenya's case and vaccination numbers are lower, showing a slower pandemic progression but also limited data reporting in earlier phases.

Vaccination rates vary dramatically, affecting the death rate and case recovery patterns across countries.

💡 Reflections
This project reinforced essential data science workflows, including:

Real-world data cleaning and wrangling

Time series analysis

Visual storytelling through charts

Communicating findings in a structured and reproducible format

The project can be extended further by:

Adding interactive dashboards

Incorporating population data for more accurate vaccination coverage

Analyzing variants and policy impacts over time
